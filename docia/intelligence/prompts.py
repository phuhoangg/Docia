# Specialized analysis guidelines for different information types
BASIC_GUIDELINES = """FOCUS ON GENERAL TEXT CONTENT:
CONTEXT: You are analyzing standard text content, paragraphs, descriptions, and explanations.
GOAL: Extract and understand the meaning, context, and key information from written text.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
- Read text content naturally and comprehensively, focusing on meaning and context

- Identify crucial facts, figures, dates, names, and specific information
- Understand the narrative flow and logical structure of the content
- Provide complete, accurate answers that directly address the specific task
- Be conversational and direct in your response while maintaining accuracy

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:
- Reading policy descriptions and procedural guidelines
- Understanding explanations of concepts or methodologies
- Extracting specific facts from descriptive text
- Analyzing written summaries or narrative content

TABLE_GUIDELINES = """FOCUS ON STRUCTURED TABLE DATA:
CONTEXT: You are analyzing structured tabular data with rows, columns, headers, and numerical information.
GOAL: Systematically extract and organize all data from tables while preserving relationships.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
- Read tables systematically: start with headers and captions, then process row by row
- Extract ALL numerical values, percentages, dates, currency amounts, and metrics
- Note table titles, captions, headers, and any footnotes or explanatory notes
- Preserve relationships between data points (which values belong to which categories)
- Identify units of measurement, scales, and data formats
- Format findings clearly with structured organization that reflects the table layout
- Pay attention to totals, subtotals, averages, and calculated values
- Note any color coding, highlighting, or special formatting that indicates importance

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:
- Financial statements with revenue, expenses, profit figures

- Note all axes labels, scales, units, and measurement ranges
- Read legends, data labels, and any annotations on the chart
- Describe overall trends, patterns, and directional movements
- Extract specific data points, values, and measurements when visible
- Highlight key insights, conclusions, and significant findings
- Note any outliers, anomalies, or notable deviations
- Compare different data series or categories if multiple are present
- Consider the time period or scope represented in the visualization

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:
- Line graphs showing trends over time (revenue growth, stock prices)
- Bar charts comparing categories or groups (sales by region, performance by team)

FOCUS AREA: Trend identification, pattern recognition, data interpretation, insight extraction"""

IMAGE_GUIDELINES = """FOCUS ON VISUAL CONTENT AND DIAGRAMS:
CONTEXT: You are analyzing visual elements including diagrams, flowcharts, illustrations, maps, and other non-text visual content.
GOAL: Describe and interpret visual information, relationships, and processes shown in images.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
- Describe the overall visual structure and layout of the image or diagram
- Identify and explain all labels, annotations, legends, and text within the visual
- Note relationships between different visual elements and components
- For flowcharts/process diagrams: explain the sequence, decision points, and flow
- For technical diagrams: identify components, connections, and their purposes
- Describe colors, symbols, icons, and their meanings in context
- Explain spatial organization and hierarchy of visual elements
- Capture any processes, workflows, or step-by-step procedures shown
- Note any scale information, measurements, or proportional relationships

Create a reformulated query that:
1. Resolves pronouns (e.g., "it", "this", "that") to their actual subjects from context
2. Keeps the query SHORT and focused ONLY on the current question's intent
3. Does NOT include previous questions or combine multiple intents

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Focus on what the user is asking NOW, not what they asked before
- Only add context needed to understand references
- Keep the query concise for optimal document search
- Do not add ```json to your response under any circumstances

Example 1:
Context: User asked about "machine learning model performance"
Current: "What about its accuracy?"
